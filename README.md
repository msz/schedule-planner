# Schedule Planner

A barebones schedule planner for your classes, coded in a couple of hours for
a friend in need. Add possible times for each class, press the button and see
the magic happen!

See repo description for link to live app.

## Building and running

You'll need TypeScript, 2.7 is guaranteed to work. Run `tsc src/script.ts` to
produce the `script.js` file. Afterwards just open `index.html`.
